### Our Mission
This website is created so people can share their ideas from all around the world! No matter what kind of major you are, your depth of knowledge, you can contribute to this website.  **You can find the original coding [if you press this link](https://github.com/Henry-Yip/Group-Project-VSCode)**

### Content
Any type of content of significance will be entertained. While it needs not be too academic, pure entertainment, for example, gaming strategies, is not allowed!
