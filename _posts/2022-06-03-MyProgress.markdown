I have no idea what is happening to me...

It seems that I am spending too much time in everything, and it's really hard to strike a balance anyways.
Writing a page like this takes me approximately 2-3 hours and since I'm on a plane to Frankfurt right now (It's landing, I have to turn off my computer in a min), it seems to be the only thing I can do (well I have chess installed also but I don't know!)

I am doing these projects simutaneously:
 - This Website
    - The most difficult stuff is the content instead of the coding (since Jekyll automatically renders markdown into html), but I need to work on the graphics also. I also need to recruit more people to join my team. (You can pm me if you want to join! Please!)
 - Coding
    - I have a book on C++ and I want to solve leetcode problems but I am a bit struggling
 - Piano
    - Preparing for diploma, but I can't really find Pianos in Edinburgh (except the one in holland house, but it's so far away from accomodation)
 - Linear Alegbra and some number theory
    - My brain fails to retain stuff learnt in semester 1 (for example Linear Algebra), so I have to have a quick glance; also, as I have 6 courses next semester (including Accelerated Year 2 courses as I skipped School of Math courses in Year 1), I better study more this summer if I want a relaxing life next semester
 - Chess 
    - Opening preparation, endgames, puzzle solvings

It's quite a busy life! But I do get really bored most of the time so getting myself really busy might be a good way out.
