There are some interesting traps for the Petrov Defense:
```bash
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 Nxe4 4. Qe2 Nd6 5. Nc6+
```
Where the discovery check wins the Queen and black is immediately lost (+8.0!)

Also note the infamous stafford gambit. Eric Rosen's "Oh no my Queen! line:

# Famous lines:
**Classical Attack, Marshall Variation**
That was the first main line I learnt back then:
```bash
1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. d4 d5 6. Bd3 Bd6 7. O-O O-O 
```
The next moves are usually **8.c4 c6  9.c6**...
However, please also note the Marshall Trap:

```bash
8.c4 Bg4 9.cxd5 f5 10.Re1? Bxh2+!
```
Note: With correct play this position can be drawn! The computer evaluates (-0.5) so the advantage is very minimal!

Obviously **11.Nxh2??** loses the Queen and we don't do this.

If you are greedy and play **11.Kxh2**, black can strike back with **11...Nxf2!** , forking the Queen and the Bishop at the same time.

After a number of exchanges, e.g.**12. Qe2 Nxd3 13. Qxd3 Bxf3**, you **cannot** take back the bishop or else you will be met by **14.Qh4!!** and your rook is lost!
