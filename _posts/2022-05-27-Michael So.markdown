  2021-2027 **M,B., Ch.B. CUHK  (Stream: Global Physician-Leadership)**
       
A student who is continuously exploring the world, particularly the world within our cranium, while trying to blur the boundaries of arts and sciences. What I have to clarify in advance is that my seemingly serious and perhaps unsatisfied facial expression just shows that I am merely thinking during such exploration. Hopefully I can graduate from the medical school on time and serve the people in need, of course, while continuing to explore the world within ourselves.
