I am a classical music enthusiast. I planned to study a Master in Arts, and eventually gave up for physics. 

Over the past 4 years, I have compiled a list of my favourite recordings.

* [_Shostakovich_ Symphony No.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fCmbe55Ykc)

A gloomy and hormoniously conflicting start turns into a light-hearted second-movement with a depressive atmostphere. This is followed by an eerily silent and longing theme that quickly turned into a furious, unrelenting finale, resolving the conflicts built up in the last 30 minutes with a sacrilegiously disturbing A Note. A symphony of fight and despair, amid the worst of times.

* [_Mahler_ Symphony No.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_FYQoqV5fk&t=3095s)

The most recognised trumpet theme is almost a tripute to Beethoven's fifth symphony, which leads to a wistfully longing theme. Struggles and memories lead us to the furious second movement,  which periodically brings back memories of first movement and brings up new life questions. This resolves into one of the beautiful adagios ever, only to be concluded by a progressing finale, blending all the questions together and solving them in a victorious style. Phenonmenal!

* [_Tchaikovsky_ Romeo and Juliet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6qZUCi7ToQ)

A sparkle turned into the wildest fire of love, only to be extinguished by a sudden death. All types of emotions in 20 minutes. Fictional but almost believing.

* [_Mendelssohn_ Symphony No.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tos7OlK5RhU&t=1392s) 

The blend of classical and romantic music, with a rigorous structure but a romantic expression. The most rigorous beginning turns into a romantic fugue-esque development, with a bold use of strings that blends with the woodwinds. The theme turns abruptly into romantic solos, only to be concluded by more strings. Victorious.

* [_Schubert_ Symphony No.8-Unfinished](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgZj4Vd3HHk)

Its status as an unfinished piece does not diminish its artistic value. A bold use of ostinato intensifies the longing theme. It almost feelings like recurring love that intensifies over time. A refreshing second movement almost symbolishes young, young love. Pleasant.

* [_Haydn_ Symphony No.88](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LonRkoYDDu0&t=215s)

I love Haydn. His music is succinct, creative but yet rigorous. The development sections feel like a dialogue. Bouncy and refreshing.
