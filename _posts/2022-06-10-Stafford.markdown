People (at least me) always relate Stafford Gambit with  **IM Eric Rosen**, a famous chess streamer. It is a variation of the [Petrov Defense]({% link _posts/2022-05-27-Petrov.markdown %}) with **3...Nc6?**, a theoreticaly lost position for black, assuming perfect play.

Top chess engines, like **Stockfish**, don't favour these types of gambits because black is lost in material, and with deep enough analysis you can almost always avoid blundering and convert your advantage into a win. However, under tight time control, (like in bullet/blitz), you can always fall into traps and lose tons of material, and that is the main goal of stafford gambit.

Please Note Eric's **"Oh No My Queen!"** Line

White thinks black is blundering and losing its queen after **6...Nxe4!!**, but simply forgot white can checkmate in a few moves despite down a queen.

There are Youtube Videos on the latest traps (there are infinitely many traps for black!). There is a very recent one posted on Eric's Youtube Channel, below I'll show the game (analysed by **Stockfish**)

In this position, please try to find the best continutation (there is **only** one, **a brilliant(!!) move**).

**12...Ne5!!**
