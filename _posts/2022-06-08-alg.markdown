Algolia Search is one of the best ways to enable searching in your Jekyll Website. For Windows users, all you need to do is to have a usuable Algolia account, cd into your directory and type:

```bash
set ALGOLIA_API_KEY=(Your ALGOLIA_API_KEY) && bundle exec jekyll algolia
```

and then edit your config_yaml, gemfile and home.html as seen in the official documentation (or whatever you want it to call. Technically this is not my home page. But remember to set the layout of this page as the layout that contains algolia.html). Anyways enjoy the result!
