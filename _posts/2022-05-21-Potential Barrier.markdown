First of all, recalling the wave-particle duality of matter, let me introduce you the SchrÃ¶dinger equation, which depicts the eqaution of wave functions:

$$\dfrac{\partial^2\Psi(x)}{\partial x^2}+\dfrac{8\pi^2m}{h}[E-U(x)]\Psi(x)=0$$

By convention, 

$$\hbar=\dfrac{h}{2\pi}$$

Therefore,

$$\dfrac{\partial^2\Psi(x)}{\partial x^2}+\dfrac{2m}{\hbar^2}[E-U(x)]\Psi(x)=0$$

Assuming a particle has energy $$E$$ and the potential step has a potential of $$U_0$$, where $$E>U_0$$.

Let $$E$$ be the kinetic energy of the particle. From Classical Mechanics, we know $$E=\frac{p^2}{2m}$$. 

Meanwhile, $$p=\hbar k$$, where $$k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$$. After cancellation, we have:

$$\dfrac{\partial^2\Psi(x)}{\partial x^2}+k^2[\Psi(x)]=0$$
