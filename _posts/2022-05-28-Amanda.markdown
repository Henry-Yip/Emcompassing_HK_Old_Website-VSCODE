Hi, my name is Amanda. I am a second-year from University of Toronto who is double 
majoring Mathematics and Statistics. My interest fields are the general use of 
statistics in business field and communication through data. In the coming academic 
year, I will be joining a research team to work on a project namely "Building a 
statistical communication and consulting community across disciplines". I will also 
be working as an assistant in the First Year Learning Community of MAT137 to further 
enhance my skulls in presenting mathematical knowledge to first year students who 
will be taking the course.
